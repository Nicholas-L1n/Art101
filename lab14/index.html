				<p>Not really sure what to put here? I feel like the results tab should have just been replaced with the new debug section. Anyways, peep the debug section on the right debugging my Lab 7 JavaScript</p>

				<p>The issue I was having, was the Google Chrome Prompt box what appear twice, once when you load the site and once after you complete the first prompt. <br><br>The reason for this, was that not really a Javascript issue, but that I linked the Javascript file twice in html. All I had to do was remove one of the links and it worked as expected. This was the only Javascript issue that I let pass for my labs, because I'm very persistent about making my code work.</p>
