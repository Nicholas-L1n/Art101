					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was a bit confused on how detailed the pseudocode was supposed to be, but I referred to the sample and tried to match  my own pseudocode to the level of specificity displayed by the professor. There's a weird visual quirk that makes pre code display exactly how it's nested in vs code and not how the code is indented from its parent. So I had to delete all the nesting tabs.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had actually set aside a large chunk of time to do the assignment and was pleasantly surprised that there was not that much work to do since we set up all the website related code last week. So I'd say I put in as much work as I could put in given the parameters of the assignment.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below is the JS Pseudocode from LAB 4, including how to clean a bathroom and rock paper scissors in outline form and in comment form.
