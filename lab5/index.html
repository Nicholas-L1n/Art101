					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Actually had no issues. What was kind of annoying, however, when working in the console if I accidentally made an error it was very difficult to go back and correct it so that everything looked pretty for the screenshot.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Like the last assignment, I had set aside a large chunk of time to sit down with my partner and work on the lab. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick the tasks were however. I finished much earlier than I expected. The lab was practice for what we learned in class.</p>
