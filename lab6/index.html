					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had an issue where I wasn't able to write multiple lines of JS in the google chrome console. But I later realized it was a snytax error and I was using "=" instead of ":" to declare variables inside of an object. Other than that everything else was smooth sailing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Being familiar with Python, Arrays and Objects really only needed me to be familiar with the JS syntax. After thursday's lecture everything was pretty clear.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below is the JS output for the array and object challenges of Lab 6.</p>
