				<p>99% of my issues were getting the jQuery to work, which only wasn't working because I was following the example on the canvas page with was missing a #.<br><br> Took me a long time to identify that as the issue. Had no other problems, even the bonus task was smooth sailing also because I already had setup the classes for the lab sections so changing the JS wasn't that difficult.

				<!-- edit here -->
				<p>Next week I want to use the newly learned jQuery functionality to replace some of the interactions I have on my site as well as add new interactions that I omitted due to a lack of integration knowledge from webflow to coding.</p>

				<header class="text-column-header">results</header>
				
				<!-- edit here -->
				<p>See the buttons added to each column.<br><br>They use jQuery to create a new button with the class "button-challenge". The button adds the class "special" to the columns.</p>
