					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>As I was designing the home page, there has been a strange logic error where the content width is set to 100vw but it surpasses 100vw when loaded. I could not figure out what was causing this to occur. When inspected, the odd space that is making the width too large can be seen, but none of the highlighted code will lead me to the issue.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Aside from assignment goal issues, the tardiness of this submission was greatly affected by Tuesday April 16th's massive power outage that lasted the whole night--further delaying the completion of my second lab. This directly correlated to the tardiness of this assignment submission. 

					I put a lot of effort into the presentation of this submission as well as the design of the website as my abilities currently allow me within the given time frame. I would have liked to add or more complex designs but that would have been much past the assignment goals and timeline. 
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below is a screenshot of file structure I created for the assignment.</p>
