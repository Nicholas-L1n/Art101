					<h2>About Nick</h2>
					<p>Hello! My name is nicholas, I'm a first year art major. I do a lot of videography, photography, graphic design and motion graphics, and ux/ui design. I practice martial arts and calisthenics, lately I've gotten into rock climbing. Love video games, currently playing Apex Legends and Tekken 8, although Helldivers 2 looks very good. I use webflow for web design so I'm familiar with html concepts, After Effects for video, and illustrator+photoshop for photography and graphic design. I also know python. Super excited for this class!</p>
